Thanks for joining this workshop! ;)

# Objectives
This workshop aims at providing a theoretical and empirical introduction to network science and its applications in social sciences. We will talk about:
- What are networks? What are the ingredients of a network? 
- How to understand/describe a network? What are the positional measurements of a node? What's the local structure? How to summary the global metrics of a network.
- How to model social networks?

We will practice:
- How to construct data for network analysis?
- How to conduct descriptive network analysis?

In a nutshell, this workshop will give you some fundamental flavors of network science and wants to be your first network science crash course. We won't cover these topics in this workshop:
- Statistical inference of a network 
- Debugging your code of SNA
- Visualization of the networks

There is no prior knowledge needed for this workshop, but some basic knowledge of Python will be helpful.
