### Disciplines that use network science
Abound literature of network analysis are from:
- Social Sciences -> Social Network Analysis (SNA)
- Mathematics -> Graph Theory
- Computer Science - > Graph 
- Economics -> Networks
- Ecology -> Networks
- Biology -> Networks

### Naming conventions
Different disciplines might use different terms for the same object in network analysis:
- Networks = Graphs
- Nodes = Vertices = Actors = Agents
- Edges = Links = Ties = Relations
- Communities = Clusters


### Topics around network analysis
- How to describe a network:
    - Statistical properties of a network, a node, and an edge
    - Node ranking
    - Network modeling
    - Network evolution
- How to predict a network:
    - Node classification (Machine Learning)
    - Link prediction 
    - Information diffusion
- How to discover knowledge from networks:
    - Frequent pattern mining: graphlet/motif mining
    - Node clustering (a.k.a. Community Detection)
    - Network resilience 
- How to use the graph as a method for data mining:
    - Network embedding 
    - Graph neural networks
