### An *informal* definition of Network

```{epigraph}
Anything that is **connected** can be modeled as a network. 

```

```{note}
Often what comes to our minds about networks are social networks. However, in reality, the application of networks can be broader!

**What about other non-human living things?**
- Protein-protein interaction networks
