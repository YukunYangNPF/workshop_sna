==========
In this part, we are going to look at descriptive network analysis. We will talk about the metrics for:
- Global structure of a network (describing the network as a whole)
- Local and Positional structures of a network (describing a part of network or describing a node/edge)

You are expected to know the most common metrics for descriptive network analysis and understand the nuances of each of the metrics after this chapter.
